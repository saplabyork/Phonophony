### About

This is the landing site for the Phonophony group.

**It’s imperative that you have the appropriate background to participate in the is course. We won't be spending any time on the basics of phonetics, phonology, or syntax as you’re expected to know this.**


### How to use this site

This site is meant to serve as a supplement to the delivered lectures and associated slides posted on [eClass](https://eclass.yorku.ca). The notes will give a bit more detail than the slides, as well as some practice problems of the type you might encounter on quizzes and exams.
